# SPA 1 17/07/2020

Today I am playing around with layout and seeing what works and what doesn't, I've found a bug with my headers that the top one spands the whole screen and my other headers around only 80%. I will see where I haven't coded this correctly otherwise, I think I know what I want to add to this website as I am confident with using the code just not using html code
