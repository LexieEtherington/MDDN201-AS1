		<h1><strong> At Home</strong></h1>
		<p> As part of my research into connections through the internet, I first started with what I could find around my flat. Not only was there connection through multiple wifi routes and eternet cables but through our key swipes to use the lifts and access into the flat</p>

			<h1>Outside</h1>	
			<p>In our day to day lives, we don't realise how many items require internet. It is easy to spot different power boxes and pipes that protect the cables going into the ground. They are more obvious connections as they photos were taken from one journey.</p>

			<h1>Underground</h1>	
			<p>In our day to day lives, we don't realise how many items require internet. As well as walking past routes, powerboxes and secruity cameras, Most connections happen underground. We can access most of these points underground and seen in my footpath marking photos, these cables work like hidden bus networks </p>
